Marcus Garvey Chain basic universal income project will demonstrate both the
reliability and effectiveness of the yNiP token on the 
ethereum blockchain to provide a basic universal income to its holders.

We believe the largest obstacle to the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies is price volatility. Cryptocurrencies,
unlike fiat currencies, do not have a central bank to implement monetary policy focused on stabilizing
purchasing power. Thus, changes in demand induce massive price fluctuations. The decentralized model to
price discovery has made the majority of existing cryptocurrencies nothing more than stocks or commodities,
valued on psychology, traded on unregulated stock markets, and susceptible to manipulation. The lack of
price stability has prevented credit and debt markets from forming because volatility incurs a premium. While
the rest of the industry focuses on transaction throughput and smart contracts, we focus on solving price
stability to realize the economic capabilities that the blockchain enables.
